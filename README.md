# PhysicsEngine
Simple Physics Engine made following the book from Ian Milling "Game Physics Engine Design"

### Currently features implemented: 
- **Mathematics of Particle (Specifically the Vector class and operations to manipulate them)**
    - Vector Class
    - Operations to manipulate Vectors
- **Laws of Motions**
    - Particle Class
    - Introduction of First and Second law
    - Integrator function
- **Force Generators**
    - Added force Accumulator to Particle
    - Created Gravity Force Generator
- **Hook's Law**
    - Springlike Force Generators
    - Created a bunch of spring-like generators (Buoyancy, Stiff Spring, Anchored Spring, ...)
