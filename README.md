# PhysicsEngine
Simple Physics Engine made following the book from Ian Milling "Game Physics Engine Design"

### Currently features implemented: 
- **Mathematics of Particle (Specifically the Vector class and operations to manipulate them)**
    - Vector Class
    - Operations to manipulate Vectors
- **Laws of Motions**
    - Particle Class
    - Introduction of First and Second law
    - Integrator function
- **Force Generators**
    - Added force Accumulator to Particle
    - Created Gravity Force Generator
- **Hook's Law**
    - Springlike Force Generators
    - Created a bunch of spring-like generators (Buoyancy, Stiff Spring, Anchored Spring, ...)
- **Hard constraint**
    - Particle contact and collisions (detection, change velocity after collision and handle interpenetration)
    - Particle Links class (Cables and Rods)

### To be implemented:
- **Mass Aggregate Physics Engine (Chapter 8)**
- **Chapters after**
